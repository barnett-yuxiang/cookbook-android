### Section I: Build Your First Flutter App

Flutter is a software development toolkit from Google for building cross-platform apps. 

Flutter’s declarative, widget-based UI structure, first-class support for reactive programming, cross platform abstractions and its virtual machine that allows for hot reloading of code changes.

Flutter is migrating to a new rendering engine called Impeller that brings better performance and consistency. It provides the same benefits as Skia and improves upon them. For the most part, you won’t have to interact directly with it, but it’s important that you are aware of its existence since Impeller is the default rendering engine for all iOS apps developed with Flutter 3.10 and above.
